                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>These terms and conditions govern your use of Neurosparks services and website. By accessing our services, you agree to be bound by these terms. We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time without prior notice. Your continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of any changes.

                    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
                    <p>All content, software, and materials provided by Neurosparks remain our exclusive property or that of our licensors.

                    <h2>Privacy</h2>
                    <p>We collect and process personal data in accordance with applicable privacy laws and our privacy policy. Client data is handled with strict confidentiality and security measures. We may use aggregated, anonymized data for improving our services and developing new solutions. Third-party integrations may have their own privacy policies which clients should review. We implement industry-standard security practices to protect data integrity and confidentiality. Data retention periods vary based on service type and legal requirements as outlined in our privacy policy.</p>

                    <h2>Liability</h2>
                    <p>Neurosparks provides services on an "as is" basis and disclaims all warranties to the maximum extent permitted by law.

                    <p>These terms are governed by the laws of India, specifically those applicable in the jurisdiction where Neurosparks Pvt Ltd is incorporated. Any disputes arising from these terms or our services shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Indian courts. International clients agree to submit to this jurisdiction for dispute resolution. Alternative dispute resolution methods, including mediation and arbitration, may be pursued before formal legal proceedings. The prevailing party in any legal dispute may be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs. If any provision of these terms is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
